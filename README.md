## About

This app allows vacations to be planned and saved. A unique identifier URL can be shared amongst friends, and multiple people can work on the same travel itinerary. It was designed to plan trips and allow everyone to get involved and excited about the future trip.


My main roles were the mapping and databasing aspects of the project, however I also helped develop and implement the user interface and experience(UI/UX). I was also instrumental in managing the project, and bringing the project to completion and delivering the job on time.

I handled the mapping and implemented the Mapbox API. The use of the API was heavily customised. I also integrated the Bookings.com API and handled the geo data to plot accomodation on the map, custom pins, custom description balloons, and affiliate links to make bookings.

I also developed the database architecture to handle the user storage and network collaborative aspect of the app. We used Google's Firebase real time database for the project.

## Tech/Framework & Dependencies
